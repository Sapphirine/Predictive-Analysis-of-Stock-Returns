Contributors: Prutha Parmar(prp2126), Prajwal Prakash(pp2719), Heetika Gada(hg2532)

Our project is divided into two parts: Part 1(Historical-data.ipynb) predicts the future stocks using historical data taken from the Winton Stock Market Challenge Kaggle.
Part 2(Realtime.ipynb) of our project deals with predictive analysis using real time data. For this we are fetching data from Alpha Vantage through free API keys provided by the same.
Note: We have not uploaded the data.
